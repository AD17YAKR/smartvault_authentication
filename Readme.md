# Auth Service

The **Auth Service** is a dedicated microservice within the Smart Warranty Vault ecosystem. It is responsible for managing user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to the platformâ€™s resources. Built with Spring Boot and leveraging Spring Security, this service provides a robust foundation for handling user credentials, token generation, and secure inter-service communication.

## Overview

The Auth Service handles the following core responsibilities:

- **User Authentication**: Verifying user credentials and issuing secure tokens.
- **Authorization**: Enforcing role-based access control to protect sensitive endpoints.
- **Security Integration**: Utilizing Spring Security along with JWT (and optionally OAuth2) for robust security practices.
- **Inter-Service Security**: Ensuring secure communication between microservices through API gateways and token validation.

## Setup and Configuration

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17** (or later)
- **Maven** or **Gradle** for building the project
- **PostgreSQL** (or your preferred relational database) for persisting user data
- A development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

### Configuration Steps

1. **Application Properties**  
   Configure the `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file with the necessary settings:
    - Database connection parameters
    - JWT secret keys and token expiration times
    - Other Spring Security related configurations

2. **Database Setup**  
   Set up your PostgreSQL database and ensure the required schema for user management is in place.

### Building and Running the Service

- **Build the Project**  
  Use Maven or Gradle to build the service:
  ```bash
  mvn clean install
